Helpers are functions that help the developer manipulate classes, without having to instantiate them.

Here you will find the helpers that exist in Solital Framework. Some specific helpers are not listed on this page, but you can find them on the next pages of the documentation.

Some helpers can be replaced by methods, as long as you use them inside a Controller.

## HTTP

* Handles the URI class. See more in [routes](routes.md).

```php
url(?string $name = null, $parameters = null, ?array $getParams)
```

* Handles the Response class.

```php
response()
```

* Handles the Request class.

```php
request()
```

* Get input class. See more in [Input and params](input-and-params.md).

```php
input(string $index = null, string $defaultValue = null, ...$methods)

# With method on Controller
$this->getRequestParams(string $index = null, string $defaultValue = null, ...$methods)
```

* Redirect to another route.

```php
to_route(string $url, ?int $code = null)

# Or, use a method on Controller
$this->redirect(string $url, ?int $code = null)
```

* Defines a limit on requests that can be made at a certain time 

```php
request_limit(string $key, int $limit = 5, int $seconds = 60)

# With method on Controller
$this->requestLimit(string $key, int $limit = 5, int $seconds = 60)
```

* Checks if a value was previously sent in the requisition.

```php
request_repeat(string $key, string $value)

# With method on Controller
$this->requestRepeat(string $key, string $value)
```

## Security

* Get current csrf-token. See more in [CSRF Protection](csrf-protection.md).

```php
csrf_token()
```

* Form method spoofing.

```php
spoofing(string $method)
```

* Generate password hash using [PHP Secure Password](https://packagist.org/packages/brenno-duarte/php-secure-password) component

```php
pass_hash($value, int $cost = 10)

# With method on Controller
$this->passHash($value, $info = false)
```

* Checks the hash generated by the `pass_hash` helper or the [PHP Secure Password](https://packagist.org/packages/brenno-duarte/php-secure-password) component

```php
pass_verify($value, string $hash)

# With method on Controller
$this->passVerify($value, $hash)
```

## Wolf Template

See [Wolf Template](wolf-template.md) to use Wolf helpers.

* Load a CSS file into the `public/assets/_css/` folder.

```php
load_css(string $asset)
```

* Loads the minified CSS file created by the `minify()->style()` method.

```php
load_min_css()
```

* Load a Javascript file into the `public/assets/_js/` folder.

```php
load_js(string $asset)
```

* Loads the minified Javascript file created by the `minify()->script()` method.

```php
load_min_js()
```

* Load a image file into the `public/assets/_img/` folder.

```php
load_img(string $asset)
```

* Load a file into the `public/assets/` folder.

```php
load_file(string $asset)
```

## Output

* Formatted `var_dump`.

```php
pre($value)
```

* Convert an array to JSON and display an error message in case of failure.

```php
encodeJSON($value)
```

* Convert a JSON to an object and display an error message in case of failure. `true` to convert JSON to an array.

```php
decodeJSON($value, bool $toArray = false)
```

* Write any message in the browser LOG, which can be viewed at any time.

```php
console_log(...$messages)
```

## Session

* Handles PHP sessions. 

To get a value from an existing session, leave the `$value` parameter empty. To create a new session, inform the session key in the first parameter, and the session value in the second parameter. See more in [Session and Cookies](session-and-cookie.md).

```php
/**
 * $key: index that will identify the session
 * $value: session value
 * $defaultValue: array of values (see Session class documentation)
 * $delete: if the value is `true`, the session will be deleted.
 * $take: returns the requested value and removes it from the session.
 */
session(string $key, mixed $value = null, mixed $defaultValue = null, bool $delete = false, bool $take = false)
```

## Debug

Debug functions are present in the [Modern PHP Exception component](https://github.com/brenno-duarte/modern-php-exception).

* An easy function to pull all details of the debug backtrace.

```php
get_debug_backtrace()
```

* Function to returns the value of var_dump() instead of outputting it.

```php
echo var_dump_buffer()
```

* PHP function to replace var_dump(), print_r() based on the XDebug style.

```php
var_dump_debug()
```

* Dump PHP value and die script.

```php
dump_die()
```

* View a PHP Closure's Source.

```php
closure_dump()
```

## Others

* Removes GET parameters in the URL and reloads the page without those parameters.

```php
remove_param()

# With method on Controller
$this->removeParamsUrl()
```

* Get the current full URL.

```php
get_url(string $uri = null)
```

* Returns trailing name component of path and get rid of trailing slashes/backslashes.

```php
mb_basename(string $path)
```

* Implode an array as key-value pairs. The third parameter is the symbol to be used between key and value.

```php
mapped_implode(string $glue, array $array, string $symbol = '=')
```

* Manipulate the `ArrayCollection` class without having to instantiate it.

```php
collection(mixed $value = null)
```

* Manipulate the `Str` class without having to instantiate it.

```php
str(string $string)
```

* Return a `SimpleCache` instance.

```php
cache(?string $drive)
```

* Memorize provides simple in-var cache for closures. It can be used to create lazy functions. Function takes closure and optional argument paramsHash. If the closure with the same arguments was run before memorize will return result from cache without the closure call. At the first call result will be calculated and stored in cache.

```php
memorize(Closure $lambda, $paramsHash = null)
```

* Returns the container defined in the `ServiceContainer` class.

```php
container(string $container_name)
```
