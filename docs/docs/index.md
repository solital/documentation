Solital is a fast, easy-to-use PHP framework and also has an easy-to-learn syntax. Created in 2020, Solital emerged as a lighter and simpler alternative to other frameworks available on the market such as Laravel, Symfony and CodeIgniter.

Solital Framework has several features to help you create PHP projects with fast performance. Vinci Console is a component to help create, remove, update components. Wolf is Solital's default template engine, as well as being quick to render views. Database manipulation is also possible using Katrina ORM, migations and seeders.

You can still use several other components present in Solital Framework.
